Features
    Getting the project onto a live website gave experience with Cpanel and the backend of web hosting with GoDaddy.
    The skill bars animate with Javascript to their respective level.
    The "Certifications" button, at the top and bottom, opens a window that displays three Mimo certificates one at a time and can be navigated through with the arrow buttons or with the page buttons.

*note* This web app is made to work on a live website through goDaddy and cPanel. In order for it to sync correctly with cPanel, the index.html file has to leave out the "Images" folder tag from the src of each image in the document - which is necessary for it to work otherwise, such as when it's downloaded from GitHub. To get the images to work in such an instance, simply add "Images" to the beginning of the src of each image in the index.html document. 
	Example: src="/leftArrow.png" --> src="Images/leftArrow.png"
    
Usage & Details
    To get a good idea of my software development skills and qualifications through a typical resume format, just with a few extra features that having it placed online allows - such at links to other websites and projects, and buttons that allow inclusions such as the certificates. So navigate around, and see if I'm a good fit for your company!
    
ChangeLog & Roadmap
    2/21/2023 : First deployment, a few of the links lead nowhere as the projects for them are not made yet.
    
    The project’s future:
    	The "Project 2 on Github" and "Other Project 1" links at the top and bottom of the page will lead to the next project once it's completed, one on GitHub and the other on the website itself.
    	Then, one more project with be completed and the "Project 3 on GitHub" and "Other Project 2" links at the top and bottom of the page will lead to that project, one leading to GitHub and the other on the website itself.
    	The "[]" within the "Profile" section will be replaced by the names of the projects once they're made, and what they were made with.
    
Credits
    Aside from looking up the average roadblock via Google, all of this was done by me with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript on an Eclipse IDE within a VM made with Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager. The OS used was Ubuntu.
