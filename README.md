	Features
Getting the project onto a live website gave experience with Cpanel and the backend of web hosting with GoDaddy.

The skill bars animate with Javascript to their respective level.
		
The "Certifications" button, at the top and bottom, opens a window that displays three Mimo certificates one at a time and can be navigated through with the arrow buttons or with the page buttons.

	ChangeLog & Roadmap
2/21/2023 : First deployment, a few of the links lead nowhere as the projects for them are not made yet.

    
The project’s future:

The "Project 2 on Github" and "Other Project 1" links at the top and bottom of the page will lead to the next project once it's completed, one on GitHub and the other on the website itself.

Then, one more project with be completed and the "Project 3 on GitHub" and "Other Project 2" links at the top and bottom of the page will lead to that project, one leading to GitHub and the other on the website itself.

The "[]" within the "Profile" section will be replaced by the names of the projects once they're made, and what they were made with.
    
	Credits
Aside from looking up the average roadblock via Google, all of this was done by me with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript on an Eclipse IDE within a VM made with Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager. The OS used was Ubuntu.
